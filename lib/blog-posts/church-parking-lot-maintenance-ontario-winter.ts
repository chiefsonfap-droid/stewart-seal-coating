      question: "Why are Ontario winters so damaging to parking lots?",
      answer: "Freeze-thaw cycles cause water in small cracks to expand, breaking asphalt apart from the inside and leading to rapid deterioration."
    },
    {
      question: "Should churches seal coat before winter?",
      answer: "Seal coating should be completed well before winter if temperatures allow. Otherwise, crack repair and inspections are better fall priorities."
    },
    {
      question: "Can snow plowing damage asphalt parking lots?",
      answer: "Yes. Metal plow blades and improper techniques can scrape asphalt surfaces, especially if cracks or weak areas already exist."

<p>Ontario winters are tough on asphalt—especially for church parking lots that sit unused during the week and see heavy traffic on weekends. Without proper preparation, freeze-thaw damage can shorten the life of your pavement and create safety risks.</p>

<p>This checklist helps churches take a proactive, stewardship-focused approach before winter sets in.</p>

<h2>Why Winter Is So Hard on Asphalt</h2>

<p>Water enters small cracks, freezes, expands, and breaks the asphalt apart. Add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Road salt</li>
<li>Snowplow abrasion</li>
<li>Temperature swings</li>
</ul>

<p>…and minor issues quickly become structural damage.</p>

<h2>Pre-Winter Maintenance Checklist</h2>

<h3>1. Inspect for Cracks</h3>

<p>Seal cracks before winter to prevent water infiltration.</p>

<h3>2. Repair Drainage Issues</h3>

<p>Standing water accelerates freeze-thaw cycles.</p>

<h3>3. Evaluate Previous Seal Coating</h3>

<p>Worn seal coating leaves asphalt exposed to moisture and salt.</p>

<h3>4. Refresh Line Striping (if needed)</h3>

<p>Visibility matters when snowbanks reduce sightlines.</p>

<h2>Winter Snow & Ice Management Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Avoid metal plow blades directly on asphalt</li>
<li>Use salt responsibly to minimize chemical damage</li>
<li>Clear snow promptly to reduce refreezing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post-Winter Assessment (Early Spring)</h2>

<p>After thaw:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for new cracks or potholes</li>
<li>Document damage for planning</li>
<li>Schedule repairs early before spring rains</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Churches Benefit from Planned Maintenance</h2>

<p>Emergency repairs are disruptive and expensive. Planned maintenance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supports safety for congregants</li>
<li>Reduces long-term costs</li>
<li>Aligns with stewardship values</li>
</ul>
