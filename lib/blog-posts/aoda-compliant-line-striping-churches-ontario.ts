<p>Accessibility isn't optional in Ontario. Under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), churches and faith-based organizations must ensure their parking facilities are accessible to all.</p>

<p>Line striping plays a critical role in compliance—and it's often overlooked.</p>

<h2>Do Churches Have to Follow AODA?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Most churches are considered organizations providing goods, services, or facilities to the public and must comply with AODA requirements.</p>

<h2>Key AODA Parking Lot Requirements</h2>

<h3>Number of Accessible Spaces</h3>

<p>Depends on total parking count.</p>

<h3>Proper Dimensions</h3>

<p>Accessible spaces must meet width and access aisle standards.</p>

<h3>Signage</h3>

<p>Vertical signage is required—not just painted symbols.</p>

<h3>Surface Markings</h3>

<p>High-contrast paint and clear symbols are essential.</p>

<h2>Why Line Striping Quality Matters</h2>

<p>Faded or incorrectly sized markings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create accessibility barriers</li>
<li>Increase liability risk</li>
<li>May fail inspections or complaints</li>
</ul>

<p>Proper striping improves safety and hospitality.</p>

<h2>When Churches Should Re-Stripe</h2>

<ul>
<li>After seal coating</li>
<li>When markings fade</li>
<li>After layout changes</li>
<li>During accessibility upgrades</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planning Accessibility as Stewardship</h2>

<p>Accessibility reflects hospitality, dignity, and care for all congregants. Investing in compliant striping protects both people and the church.</p>
