<p>Cracks may seem minor—but in Ontario's climate, they're the fastest way for asphalt to fail. <strong>Crack repair is one of the most cost-effective maintenance steps churches can take.</strong></p>

<h2>Why Cracks Spread So Quickly in Ontario</h2>

<p>Freeze-thaw cycles force water to expand beneath the surface, breaking asphalt apart from the inside.</p>

<p>Here's the destructive cycle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Water enters a small crack</li>
<li>Temperature drops below freezing</li>
<li>Water expands 9% as it becomes ice</li>
<li>Crack widens</li>
<li>More water enters</li>
<li>Cycle repeats 30-50 times per Ontario winter</li>
</ol>

<p>A ¼-inch crack in fall can become a 1-inch crack by spring.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Crack Repair</h2>

<ul>
<li>Prevents water infiltration</li>
<li>Extends seal coating lifespan</li>
<li>Delays resurfacing</li>
<li>Improves safety</li>
<li>Costs $3-$5 per linear foot vs $50-$100 per pothole later</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hot-Pour vs Cold-Pour: Why Method Matters</h2>

<h3>Hot-Pour Rubberized (Recommended)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Applied at 375°F</li>
<li>Bonds directly to crack walls</li>
<li>Remains flexible through temperature changes</li>
<li>Lasts 3-5 years</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cold-Pour (Budget Option)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hardens and cracks in freeze-thaw</li>
<li>Fails within 1-2 years</li>
<li>Requires re-application</li>
<li>Often costs more long-term</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Time for Crack Repair</h2>

<p>Late spring through early fall, before temperatures drop below 10°C consistently.</p>

<p><strong>Optimal windows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Spring (May-June):</strong> Address winter damage</li>
<li><strong>Fall (September-October):</strong> Protect before winter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stewardship Through Early Action</h2>

<p>Fixing cracks early protects ministry resources and avoids emergency repairs. A $500 crack filling project today prevents a $5,000 resurfacing project in 3 years.</p>
