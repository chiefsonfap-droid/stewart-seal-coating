      question: "How often should church parking lots be seal coated in Ontario?",
      answer: "Most church parking lots in Ontario should be seal coated every 2–3 years, depending on traffic levels, sun exposure, and how well cracks are maintained."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if seal coating is delayed too long?",
      answer: "Delaying seal coating allows water and salt to penetrate the asphalt, accelerating cracking and potentially leading to costly resurfacing instead of affordable maintenance."
    },
    {
      question: "Does crack repair affect how often seal coating is needed?",
      answer: "Yes. Regular crack repair helps preserve the asphalt base and can extend the effective lifespan of seal coating."

<p>One of the most common questions church facility managers ask is: <strong>How often should we seal coat our parking lot?</strong> The answer depends on traffic, weather exposure, and how proactively the asphalt has been maintained.</p>

<p>In Ontario's climate, seal coating isn't optional maintenance—it's a key part of protecting a major capital asset.</p>

<h2>General Rule for Ontario Churches</h2>

<p>For most church parking lots in Ontario:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Every 2–3 years is ideal</strong></li>
<li>High-traffic areas may need more frequent attention</li>
<li>Low-traffic rural churches may extend to 3–4 years with good crack repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Waiting too long increases long-term costs.</p>

<h2>Factors That Affect Seal Coating Frequency</h2>

<h3>1. Traffic Patterns</h3>

<p>Church lots experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heavy use on weekends</li>
<li>Concentrated traffic near entrances</li>
<li>Occasional events causing spikes</li>
</ul>

<p>High-turn zones wear faster than perimeter areas.</p>

<h3>2. Sun Exposure</h3>

<p>UV damage dries asphalt and accelerates oxidation—especially in open, unshaded lots.</p>

<h3>3. Crack Maintenance</h3>

<p>Lots with regular crack repair can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend seal coating intervals</li>
<li>Prevent water infiltration</li>
<li>Reduce base damage</li>
</ul>

<p>Neglected cracks shorten the life of seal coating.</p>

<h2>Signs Your Church Lot Is Due</h2>

<p>Look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fading from deep black to grey</li>
<li>Rough or dry texture</li>
<li>Small cracks beginning to form</li>
<li>Previous seal coat wearing thin in drive lanes</li>
</ul>

<p>These are early warnings—not cosmetic issues.</p>

<h2>Why Churches Should Avoid "Waiting Until It's Bad"</h2>

<p>Once asphalt begins breaking apart:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seal coating is no longer effective</li>
<li>Resurfacing becomes the only option</li>
<li>Costs increase dramatically</li>
</ul>

<p>Preventative seal coating is far more affordable than structural repair.</p>

<h2>A Stewardship-Based Maintenance Cycle</h2>

<p>Many Ontario churches follow a 3–5 year stewardship plan:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Inspection + crack repair</li>
<li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Seal coating</li>
<li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Monitoring and touch-ups</li>
<li>Repeat cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach supports budgeting, safety, and long-term planning.</p>

<h2>When an Inspection Makes Sense</h2>

<p>If you're unsure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schedule an inspection in spring or early summer</li>
<li>Use aerial assessments for larger properties</li>
<li>Document condition for board or committee review</li>
</ul>

<p>A clear condition report simplifies decision-making.</p>
