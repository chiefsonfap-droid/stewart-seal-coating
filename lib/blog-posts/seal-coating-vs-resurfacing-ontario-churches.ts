<p>Church boards often face a difficult question: Do we seal coat—or do we resurface? Understanding the difference is critical for responsible budgeting and stewardship.</p>

<h2>What Seal Coating Does</h2>

<p>Seal coating:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protects existing asphalt</li>
<li>Extends lifespan</li>
<li>Improves appearance</li>
<li>Costs significantly less</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It does not fix structural damage.</strong></p>

<h2>What Resurfacing Involves</h2>

<p>Resurfacing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adds a new asphalt layer</li>
<li>Corrects widespread cracking</li>
<li>Is far more expensive</li>
<li>Disrupts access longer</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Decide</h2>

<h3>Seal coating is appropriate when:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Asphalt is structurally sound</li>
<li>Cracks are minimal and repairable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resurfacing is needed when:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Base failure exists</li>
<li>Potholes are widespread</li>
<li>Asphalt is crumbling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Budgeting with a Stewardship Mindset</h2>

<p>Preventative maintenance saves tens of thousands over time. Many Ontario churches delay too long and lose the seal coating window entirely.</p>

<h3>Typical Cost Comparison</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Seal coating:</strong> $0.20-$0.35 per square foot</li>
<li><strong>Resurfacing:</strong> $3.00-$6.00 per square foot</li>
<li><strong>Full replacement:</strong> $8.00-$12.00+ per square foot</li>
</ul>

<p>A 10,000 square foot parking lot:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seal coating: $2,000-$3,500</li>
<li>Resurfacing: $30,000-$60,000</li>
<li>Replacement: $80,000-$120,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planning Ahead</h2>

<p>Regular inspections and seal coating every 2-3 years can extend asphalt life by decades, delaying or even eliminating the need for expensive resurfacing.</p>
