<p>Reactive repairs strain church budgets. A 3–5 year maintenance plan aligns asphalt care with stewardship principles and long-term financial health.</p>

<h2>Why Long-Term Planning Works</h2>

<ul>
<li>Predictable costs</li>
<li>Fewer emergencies</li>
<li>Better contractor scheduling</li>
<li>Improved safety</li>
<li>Extended pavement life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample 5-Year Plan</h2>

<h3>Year 1: Assessment & Crack Repair</h3>

<ul>
<li>Professional spring inspection</li>
<li>Hot-pour crack filling</li>
<li>Document baseline condition</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $500-$1,500</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 2: Seal Coating & Line Striping</h3>

<ul>
<li>Two-coat seal coating application</li>
<li>AODA-compliant line striping</li>
<li>Accessibility review</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $3,000-$7,000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 3: Monitor & Minor Touch-Ups</h3>

<ul>
<li>Visual inspection</li>
<li>Small crack repairs as needed</li>
<li>Minor striping touch-ups</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $0-$500</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 4: Crack Repair</h3>

<ul>
<li>Spring inspection</li>
<li>Address new cracks</li>
<li>Drainage improvements if needed</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $500-$1,500</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 5: Seal Coating & Assessment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Second seal coating cycle</li>
<li>Line striping refresh</li>
<li>Plan next 5-year cycle</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $3,000-$7,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total 5-Year Investment:</strong> $7,000-$17,500<br>
<strong>Average Annual Cost:</strong> $1,400-$3,500</p>

<h2>Alternative: 3-Year Intensive Plan</h2>

<p>For lots showing more wear:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Inspection + comprehensive crack repair</li>
<li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Seal coating + striping</li>
<li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Inspection + crack repair, then repeat</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aligning with Church Budget Cycles</h2>

<h3>Budget Planning Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Present 3-5 year plan to boards annually</li>
<li>Include maintenance in capital budgets</li>
<li>Consider reserve funds for parking lot</li>
<li>Schedule major work during low-attendance seasons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Presenting to Church Boards</h3>

<p>Effective presentations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current condition photos</li>
<li>Multi-year cost breakdown</li>
<li>Cost comparison: prevention vs emergency repair</li>
<li>Safety and accessibility implications</li>
<li>Stewardship framework</li>
</ul>

<h2>Funding Strategies</h2>

<h3>Annual Operating Budget</h3>

<p>Include $1,500-$3,500 annually for planned maintenance</p>

<h3>Capital Reserve Fund</h3>

<p>Set aside funds specifically for major projects (resurfacing/replacement)</p>

<h3>Special Appeals</h3>

<p>Some churches fundraise for facility improvements</p>

<h3>Grants & Subsidies</h3>

<p>Check for accessibility or heritage property funding</p>

<h2>Benefits of Proactive Planning</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Financial:</strong> Preventative maintenance costs 80% less than reactive repairs</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> Fewer trip hazards and liability risks</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Maintained AODA compliance</li>
<li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Protects community investment</li>
<li><strong>Testimony:</strong> Well-maintained facilities reflect organizational values</li>
</ul>

<h2>When Plans Need Adjustment</h2>

<p>Unexpected issues may require plan changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Severe winter damage</li>
<li>Drainage failures</li>
<li>Base settling</li>
<li>Unexpected usage increases</li>
</ul>

<p>Annual inspections catch problems early and allow plan adjustments before costs escalate.</p>
